# Filipay

The AFCS, also known as Filipay, introduced cashless payment methods, real-time data monitoring, and fleet management capabilities, setting a new standard for public transportation in the Philippines. It became the first in the country to implement the Tap In/Tap Out contactless fare payment system. It facilitated various payment types, including QR codes and contactless cards, providing commuters with a seamless and efficient fare payment experience.
